#Pirate Maze Assignment/Ethical Principles 

For the pirate maze assignment, I was given code that designed a maze for an intelligent agent to navigate. It was my job to add code that would aid in
training the intelligent agent to keep repeating the maze over and over, training it to be able to beat a human in both navigating correctly and quickly.
In this code, I created a for loop to navigate through each epoch. I then created a while loop to keep the IA functioning until the end of the game.

Computer scientists are very important to our present and future. Because humans are relying more and more on technology and innovation to control our
lives, it is the job of the computer scientist to invent new ideas to make our lives better, and refine old ones to do things more quickly and efficiently.
This matters because without technology in our lives, I don’t know how we would function as a society anymore. I imagine the TV show that came out several
years ago called “Revolution.” In that show, power went out completely around the world, and we as humans could barely cope. If that were to happen, I 
truly believe that some people couldn’t care for themselves properly. Many would perish. Without computer scientists, that fiction could become a reality.

When approaching a problem, computer scientists must first analyze the issue. They must determine the need or want, and come up with a solution for that
problem. At the start, the scientist must break the problem down into small pieces. It is far easier to create something small then test it as opposed to
creating a large program and then trying to figure out what part of the code has errors because it is so large. Additionally, collaborating with other
computer scientists is essential. Others can see more deeply into a problem and offer solutions when you may not be able to see the problem. These are also
beneficial ideas to implement when one needs to meet client needs, because communication and problem solving are key to making a client happy.

When meeting needs of a client or organization, there are ethical principles a computer scientist must always adhere to. First and foremost, one should not
create programs that are harmful to others. If hired to create something like this, a scientist must say no. Secondly, any program created that is used to
share personal or private information without the user’s consent is unjust and unethical. If the user does not have the opportunity to give permission to
share personal information, then that personal information is obtained illegally and is against the law. Finally, any program created must clearly
advertise the claim that personal information will be used in running the program. It must be posted upon starting up an app or using a computer program so
that a user will not forget and then be upset later when the information is used.
